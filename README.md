CARDIOVASCULAR ANALYSIS DASHBOARD 


🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of cardiovascular health data, helping visualize key medical and lifestyle factors that influence the risk of heart disease.
The dashboard was designed to identify patterns, correlations, and trends across patient demographics, clinical indicators, and behavioral habits — enabling better understanding and decision-making in preventive healthcare.

For more information i created a ML model of CVD (cardiovascular disease) detector

🎯 Objective

To analyze cardiovascular-related factors such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose level, BMI, and lifestyle habits (like smoking or physical activity) and uncover insights that can help predict or prevent heart disease.



📊 Key Insights & Visuals

Age vs. CVD Risk: Understand how cardiovascular disease prevalence changes with age.

Cholesterol and Glucose Levels: Correlation between elevated cholesterol/glucose and heart disease.

BMI Distribution: Detect obesity trends and their contribution to CVD.

Blood Pressure Analysis: Visualize hypertension patterns across different patient groups.

Smoking & Physical Activity: Assess the impact of smoking and sedentary behavior on heart health.

Gender-based Comparison: Compare cardiovascular risk and health indicators between males and females.

Overall CVD Count & Percentage: Highlight total affected individuals and overall disease ratio.



🧠 Data-Driven Storytelling

This dashboard goes beyond numbers — it tells a data story:

Who is at higher risk?

What lifestyle or medical factors contribute most?

How can health outcomes improve with early intervention?

By combining visual analytics with predictive understanding, it supports both public health professionals and data analysts in identifying at-risk populations.

💡 Highlights

Clean and visually appealing UI with consistent color theme

Interactive slicers to filter data by gender, age group, cholesterol level, and smoking status

KPIs that summarize CVD count, average BMI, average BP, and cholesterol level

Data storytelling for medical insight and awareness


🧩 Outcome

This analysis reveals that:

Individuals with high cholesterol (>200 mg/dL), elevated blood pressure (>120 mmHg), high glucose (>140 mg/dL), high BMI (>25), or smoking habits show a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

Maintaining healthy BMI, regular physical activity, and controlled blood pressure reduces CVD risk.
